# Little Lemon Website Project

## Project Description
This project was created during Meta's Front-End Development course on Coursera. This website was the culmination of the Front-End Development Track.

This website demonstrated the implementation of a booking application on the Little Lemon website. This was created with React Components to demonstrate an understanding of how to use React to create a website. This also includes utilizing API calls.

Please note: the only functionality working on this website besides the design is the Reserve a Table function.

## Screenshots
Here are some screeenshots of the application showcasing the Booking functionality.
